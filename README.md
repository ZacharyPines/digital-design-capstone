# digital-design-capstone
This project was created as part my CSE120 capstone. It showcases a two-sided bridge controller system that uses state-based logic to manage the opening and closing of gates when a person is on the bridge. The main file for the project is Capstone.pdf, but includes the .dig and .v files that drive the project.
